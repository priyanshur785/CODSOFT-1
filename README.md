#Titanic Survival Prediction Internship Project
Introduction
Briefly introduce the project and its context. Mention that this project was completed as part of your internship at Codsoft.

Task Description
Explain the task you were assigned: Titanic Survival Prediction. Describe what the goal of the task was, and provide some context about the dataset and the problem you were trying to solve.

Data
Describe the Titanic dataset you worked with. Mention the features (columns) available in the dataset, what each feature represents, and the target variable you were trying to predict (survived or not). If possible, provide a link to the dataset source.

Approach
Explain the approach you took to tackle the Titanic Survival Prediction task. You could mention the steps you followed, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

Code Overview
Provide a high-level overview of your code structure. You can list the main files or scripts you used and a brief description of what each of them does.

Results
Discuss the results you achieved. You could include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score that you used to evaluate your model's performance. If you tried multiple models, mention which one performed the best and any insights you gained from the analysis.

How to Run the Code
Provide instructions for someone else to run your code on their machine. Include details about any dependencies they need to install, how to set up the environment, and how to execute the code.

Conclusion
Summarize your internship experience working on the Titanic Survival Prediction task. Discuss what you learned, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them. Mention any future improvements you'd make to the project given more time.
